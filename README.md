Hey there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Mayssa, a Computer Science graduate, Software Engineering student, creative coder and self-proclaimed UI/UX designer. My current mission is improving both my technical and soft skills.

ðŸ’» I'm currently working with Python along with learning Automation, Docker, Jenkins and other skills.

âš¡ Fun fact: I got a dog to get over my fear of dogs and she's now part of the family.
